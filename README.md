##tonight.pm

tonight.pm is a handy tool to facilitate RSVPs on the day of an event. Maybe you have a weekly meetup or a group of friends who all go to the same bar, and it would help if you knew how many people were going to be there.

By visiting your own page at anything.tonight.pm, you and your friends can quickly add yourselves to the list of attendees and get on with your day.

Pages reset automatically 24 hours after the first entry is added to them— tonight.pm is a tool for short-term RSVPs. This also prevents people from camping on simple, short subdomains, so if your bowling league meets on Mondays and some other person on the internet has one on Fridays, you can both use `bowling.tonight.pm` without any conflict. Neat!
